# Lucien Simpfendoerfer--12 Day Program Milestone Project

This respository contains code for my 12-Day Program Milestone Project. 

The corresponding Heroku app can be found [here](http://lucien-stock-ticker.herokuapp.com/). 

NOTE: For the code to work on your local machine, you must add a file called 'global_vbls.py' with a variable called quandl_key, which is set equal to your [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/) API key. I haven't uploaded my key to Github for security reasons.
